    "excerpt": "The FASB issued the new CECL accounting standard in June 2016 for estimating allowances for credit losses. What does this mean for your bank?",
    "text": "<p>The Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued a new accounting standard in June 2016, introducing the current expected credit losses methodology (CECL) for estimating allowances for credit losses. While most banks were required to comply following December 15, 2019, smaller and mid sized banks only need to begin following it after December 15, 2022.</p><p><strong>What does this mean?</strong></p><p>Unlike the previous accounting that allowed banks to report the value of an asset, like a loan, at the time it was originated (“incurred loss&quot;), the new methodology requires banks to have a forecast over their current balance sheet to determine the amount of reserves to have on hand.</p><p>Forecasting, however, is tough, and even U.S. regulatory agencies realize that no one is going to get it right. But that&apos;s also not an excuse to completely miss the mark: the responsibility is on banks to do their due diligence and prepare credible forecasts. The specific language that the Office of Comptroller of Currency (OCC) uses is “reasonable and supportable.&quot; While it&apos;s not enough to simply look at historical data, banks can, of course, use historical data to inform their forecast.</p><p>Let&apos;s turn to their specific language</p><blockquote>326-20-30-9: An entity shall not rely solely on past events to estimate expected credit losses. When an entity uses historical loss information, it shall consider the need to adjust historical information to reflect the extent to which management expects current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts to differ from the conditions that existed for the period over which historical information was evaluated. The adjustments to historical loss information may be qualitative in nature and should reflect changes related to relevant data (such as changes in unemployment rates, property values, commodity values, delinquency, or other factors that are associated with credit losses on the financial asset or in the group of financial assets). Some entities may be able to develop reasonable and supportable forecasts over the contractual term of the financial asset or a group of financial assets. However, an entity is not required to develop forecasts over the contractual term of the financial asset or group of financial assets. Rather, for periods beyond which the entity is able to make or obtain reasonable and supportable forecasts of expected credit losses, an entity shall revert to historical loss information determined in accordance with paragraph 326-20-30-8 that is reflective of the contractual term of the financial asset or group of financial assets. An entity shall not adjust historical loss information for existing economic conditions or expectations of future economic conditions for periods that are beyond the reasonable and supportable period. An entity may revert to historical loss information at the input level or based on the entire estimate. An entity may revert to historical loss information immediately, on a straight-line basis, or using another rational and systematic basis.</blockquote><p>That paragraph has three main points:</p><ul class='blog-list'><li>Estimates of loan reserves based on historical data alone is insufficient</li><li>Qualitative adjustments to historical data can be based on judgment, but that judgment should be anchored in some way in relevant data</li><li>Entities can, but are not required to, develop reasonable and supportable forecasts over the contractual term of an asset, and in those cases should revert to credible historical estimates</li></ul><p><strong>Existing approaches</strong></p><p>But that begs the question, what data is relevant for creating a forecast? As far as we know, the existing consulting or software packages fall into one of two categories:</p><ol><li>Forecast economic conditions using national data</li><li>Produce multiple scenarios of high, medium or low forecasts based on qualitative factors</li></ol><p>Each approach has substantial limitations. Approach #1 takes a one-size-fits-all approach using 1980s econometric methods, rather than state-of-the-art machine learning models that can accommodate big data at more disaggregated levels, such as a zipcode or a county. Given that small and medium sized banks are inherently local and specialize in niche areas, a one-size-fits-all approach may force banks to hold out more reserves than they really need based on their own risk profile.</p><p>Setting aside the importance of regional heterogeneity and the specific ecosystem that each bank operates in, off-the-shelf macroeconometric tools are highly inaccurate. These packages do not follow best practices from computer science where, for example, the modeler holds out a subset of years and uses the model to produce an out-of-sample forecast that is compared with the data that was held out. Instead, the models are fit over the entire data, producing in-sample fits that are overly optimistic. Moreover, these forecasts can change on a whim; organizations routinely update forecasts to “take into account updated economic conditions&quot; without conceding that their earlier forecast was off. Simply put, forecasting today is highly inaccurate and may give the impression of security because of all the equations, but in reality they fail to reflect the dynamic features of the data.</p><p>Approach #2, while much simpler, also has its own challenges, namely the arbitrary nature of the high, medium, and low forecasts. What is to say 3% gross domestic product growth is high and 1% is low? A recent vein of economics research has pointed out that productivity has slowed over the past two decades, with some economists calling it an era of “secular stagnation,&quot; so does that mean that 1% GDP growth is high? The problem here is that the thresholds are arbitrary and do not take advantage of the availability of vast amounts of data that can be used to discipline the forecast.</p><p>Dissatisfaction with current forecasting methods abounds. While the large banks have their own teams to handle bank-specific forecasts, which often make the news when these forecasts are released, smaller and mid sized banks do not have the budget to hire teams of data scientists and economists. Michael Gullette, senior vice president, tax and accounting at the American Bankers Association (ABA), has commented that ABA roundtables have revealed substantial concern among these smaller banks about how to make adjustments to their forecasts based on emerging economic events. “The big banks had a grip on that,&quot; Gullette said. “They&apos;ve understood progressively over the last few years that that is where we&apos;re headed, but the smaller banks [under $30 billion in assets] not so much. They&apos;re saying, &apos;How do we support these adjustments?&apos;&quot;</p><p><strong>Our data-driven approach</strong></p><p>We believe that sophisticated forecasting tools should be available to everyone, much like the consumer product and service industry (e.g., internet and iPhones). Using data from a wide array of seemingly disparate sources, ranging from the Census Bureau to Bureau of Labor Statistics, we build highly reliable predictive models around each asset class. Crucially, we include local information, rather than just national averages, when computing forecasts for an area and asset class. </p><p>Further, we can explicitly show our degree of accuracy using standard methods from computer science, often referred to as cross-validation. That way, we can show exactly how accurate our models are and quickly identify where there are gaps so that they can be rectified and caveated.</p><p>Once we obtain predictions for each asset class, we now have its contemporaneous value and a forecast. We run that forecast forward for however many years are on the contractual term of the asset, whether it&apos;s a 30 year fixed rate mortgage or a 5-1 adjustable rate mortgage. We also obtain a confidence interval over these estimates so that we have a band of uncertainty.</p><p>Then, the decision over how many reserves to hold is up to the bank: how many reserves do you need so that you do not fall below a particularly worrisome threshold?</p><p>Join us on the journey.</p>"

    "text": "<p>The Current and Expected Credit Losses (CECL) standard was introduced by the Financial Accounting Standards Board a few years ago, and all banks must transition by December 15, 2022.

    "text": "<p>The current expected credit losses methodology (CECL) for estimating allowances for credit losses requires that banks develop reasonable and supportable forecasts, which we&apos;ve written about before here. But once you have a reasonable and supportable forecast, how do you actually determine the amount of capital reserves that you need?</p><p>Conceptually, when forecasts suggest a downturn, a bank needs to have more reserves on hand. The rationale is simple: in a downturn, consumers and businesses are more likely to be delinquent on their loans, which not only reduces cash flow for a bank, but also increases the odds of foreclosure on the property, thereby affecting the value of their balance sheet and financial stability. In this sense, having more reserves on hand provides an extra cushion in the event of a crisis.</p><p>But holding reserves is costly. Sticking cash under a mattress has an opportunity cost – banks cannot loan that money out to provide investment and consumption opportunities to consumers and businesses, in turn generating revenue on the interest on those loans. </p><p>We need a gold standard approach to determining reserves, striking the right balance between mitigating any risk of bank insolvency and providing value-generating opportunities.</p><p>We believe that modeling capital reserves is not rocket science – and frankly there&apos;s probably more art than science in the modeling exercise since economics is fundamentally about behavior. Fancy models are helpful, but they cannot eliminate uncertainty all together. Here&apos;s our approach:</p><ol><li>Generate bank or region specific forecasts – Depending on the size of the bank, you may simply need to know what&apos;s happening to a state or metropolitan area, but the key is that you obtain local predictions, rather than national ones. Even during the financial crisis of 2007-08, there were still some counties that were doing well, so especially for small and mid sized banks that do not have national exposure, there is no sense in using national forecasts.</li><li>Obtain a confidence interval on the forecast – The quality and availability of data allows us to produce forecasts that have some degree of precision. Then, you want to choose how much precision you are willing to accept – for example, a 99% confidence interval might be more than enough to rule out negative outcomes, particularly in light with other risks that the bank might take on a more regular basis.</li><li>Toggle the amount of reserves by asset class to achieve the desired level of safety – Since each asset class is differentially exposed to risk because of either the composition of buyers in the market or other complementary asset classes it is linked to, banks can play around with different choices of reserves across the asset classes they are invested in to achieve their desired level of safety and security.</li></ol><p>These are not easy to do overnight for an organization, but we have made the tools available on our platform so that you do not need to go through the painstaking process of building it from scratch.</p><p>Learn more about the Dainamic Dashboard.</p>"

    "excerpt": "By anticipating potential credit losses, banks can better allocate capital and resources, minimizing the impact of financial stress on their operations.",
    "text": "<p>Accurate loss forecasting is crucial for banks to ensure financial stability and maintain regulatory compliance, particularly in the era of the Current Expected Credit Loss (CECL) accounting standard. By anticipating potential credit losses, banks can better allocate capital and resources, minimizing the impact of financial stress on their operations.</p><p>Here we will examine how banks can refine their credit loss estimation models to improve loss forecastings, risk management, and financial performance.</p><p><strong>1. Start with data collection and management</strong></p><p>If you want a good model, it all starts with good data and if you want a truly robust credit loss estimation model you will need access to  high-quality financial and market data. This would include loan-level data, like borrower characteristics, loan terms, and payment history. Additionally, banks should incorporate relevant macroeconomic variables, such as GDP growth, unemployment rates, and interest rates, which may affect credit losses.</p><p>Proper data management is also essential for maintaining data accuracy and consistency. Banks should develop a data governance framework that clearly defines roles, responsibilities, and processes for data collection, validation, storage, and updating. Implementing such a framework can help banks maintain data integrity and ensure that their models are based on reliable inputs.</p><p><strong>2. Selection of Appropriate Modeling Techniques for Credit Loss Estimation</strong></p><p>There is no one-size-fits-all approach to credit loss estimation, and banks should carefully consider the most suitable modeling techniques for their specific portfolio and risk profile.</p><p>Commonly used techniques include:</p><ul class='blog-list'><li>Statistical models, such as linear regression, logistic regression, or survival analysis, which can estimate credit losses based on historical data and relationships between variables.</li><li>Machine learning techniques, such as random forests, neural networks, or gradient boosting machines, which can identify complex patterns and non-linear relationships in data.</li><li>Expert judgment, in which subject matter experts provide input on model assumptions, parameter estimates, or qualitative adjustments based on their experience and knowledge.</li></ul><p>Banks should compare the performance of different modeling techniques and select the most appropriate method, or a combination of methods, that best captures the dynamics of their portfolio.</p><p><strong>3. Regular Model Validation and Calibration for Accurate Loss Forecasting</strong></p><p>Regular model validation is essential for ensuring the accuracy and reliability of credit loss estimation models. Banks should establish a systematic model validation process that includes:</p><ul class='blog-list'><li>Back-testing: Comparing model predictions with actual outcomes to assess the model's predictive accuracy.</li><li>Sensitivity analysis: Assessing the model's performance under different assumptions or input values to gauge its stability.</li><li>Benchmarking: Comparing the model's performance with alternative models or industry standards.</li></ul><p>Based on the validation results, banks should regularly calibrate their models, adjusting parameters or assumptions to improve accuracy and reflect changes in the economic environment, portfolio composition, or regulatory requirements.</p><p><strong>4. Incorporating Forward-Looking Scenarios in Credit Loss Forecasting</strong></p><p>CECL guidelines emphasize the importance of considering future economic conditions when estimating credit losses. Banks should incorporate forward-looking scenarios in their models, reflecting a range of plausible outcomes, such as baseline, adverse, and severely adverse economic scenarios. Scenario analysis can help banks better understand how their credit losses may evolve under different economic conditions and inform their capital planning and risk management strategies.</p><p><strong>5. Integrating Loss Forecasting with Risk Management Practices for Effective Banking Operations</strong></p><p>Loss forecasting should not be an isolated exercise but rather an integral part of a bank's risk management framework. Banks should align their loss forecasting processes with other risk management practices, such as stress testing, capital planning, and portfolio management. By integrating loss forecasting into their risk management systems, banks can more effectively monitor and manage credit risk and make informed strategic decisions.</p><p><strong>Final thoughts</strong></p><p>Enhancing loss forecasting capabilities is critical for banks to navigate the complex and evolving financial landscape. By focusing on data collection and management, selecting appropriate modeling techniques, regularly validating and calibrating their models, incorporating forward-looking scenarios, and integrating loss forecasting with risk management practices, banks can improve their credit loss estimation models and better prepare for potential</p>"
